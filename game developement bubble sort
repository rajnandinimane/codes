/*Game Development:
write a game development program that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm. The program
will simulate a simple game where the player can input a set of numbers, and the numbers will
be sorted using Bubble Sort to simulate a "level-up" scenario where the player's scores are sorted
in ascending order. **/
